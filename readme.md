## Description

Invite your friends, create a room with your desktop computer and join it with your mobile phones.

It's a multiplayer game you can play with your mobile phone. It's designed for up to 4 players. The goal of the game is to "shoot" the green circles. The first player to 10 hits will win the game.

WoE is meant as a multiplayer game you should play with gamers sitting next to you. Because your mobile phone is just a controller and all the user interaction is happening on one screen.
